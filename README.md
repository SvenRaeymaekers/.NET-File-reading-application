# coding_assessment

This repository contains a coding assessment I completed. The goal of the coding assessment was to test my coding skills in .NET/C#. The focus in this assignment is applied
on scalability and maintainability of code and for that reason I applied Architectural design patterns (e.g. MVC) and software design patterns (strategy and factory pattern).

This repo contains limited documentation on requirements and design choices, which canbe found in FileReaderApp_documentation.pdf.
