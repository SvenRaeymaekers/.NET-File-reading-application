# Coding Assessment

This repository contains a coding assessment I completed. The goal of the coding assessment was to test my coding skills in .NET/C#. The focus in this assignment is applied
on scalability and maintainability of code. For that reason, some design patterns and architectural patterns are applied (MVC, Strategy Pattern, Factory Pattern, ... ).

This repo contains limited documentation on requirements and design choices, which can be found in FileReaderApp_documentation.pdf.
