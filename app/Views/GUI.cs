//NOT IMPLEMENTED, just a quick brainstorm 

// a field to type out a file path OR upload a file, and then sends the file path 
// path to the controller

//a checkbox which says; is your file encrypted
    // IF CHECKED
        // show a dropdown with the encryption algorithms
    // IF NOT CHECKED
        //hide the dropdown, and make sure that the Read File button on bottom sends the correct
        // request, with bool isEncrypted = False and string encryptionAlgorithm =""

//a field that will show error messages
// a button which says: Read File, which starts the file reading functionality.
// a field that shows the output of the file reading func. so the file contents.
// if possible, make a new window pop up with a text area that shows the file content (scrollable maybe)
// a button that says Close Window, that closes the subwindow.
